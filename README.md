# Rigvedic Similes: a corpus-based study of their forms and functions

This repository contains the treebanked version of the Rigveda (RV) employed for the analyses presented in the book ***Rigvedic similes: a corpus-based study of their forms and functions***. The treebank presented here is part of the bigger [Vedic Treebank](https://github.com/OliverHellwig/sanskrit/tree/master/papers/2020lrec) (Hellwig et al. 2020).

The repository also describes the annotation scheme employed for Rgvedic similes and related constructions, which is a customized version of the annotation scheme provided by [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org) for [comparative constructions](https://universaldependencies.org/workgroups/comparatives.html), as well as all queries emplyed in Chapters 4, 6, and 8, and written with [Udapi](https://udapi.github.io), a Python framework for processing Universal Dependencies data. 

Finally, this  repository contains data and R scripts employed for the Collexeme Analysis (simple, co-varying and distinctive CA) of Rigvedic similes presented in Chpater 6. Such scripts where adapted from Chapters 10 and 11 of Natalia Levshina's *How to do linguistics with R* (2015) and from the [{collustructions}](https://sfla.ch/collostructions/) script v.0.2.0 by Susanne Flach (2021).

This should allow full replicability of all the analyses presented in this book.
