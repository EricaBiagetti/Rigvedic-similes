This repository contains the treebanked version of the Rigveda (RV) employed for the analyses presented in the book "Rigvedic similes: a corpus-based study of their forms and functions".

The repository also describes the annotation scheme, which is a customized version of the annotation scheme provided by Universal Dependencies for comparative constructions, and all queries run with Udapi, a Python framework for processing Universal Dependencies data. 

It also contains data and R scripts employed for the Collexeme Analysis (simple, co-varying and distinctive CA) of Rigvedic similes presented in Chpater 6. 

This should allow full replicability of all the analyses presented in this book.
